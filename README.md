# WEEKLY-Q-As
Here is the place for:

ðŸš€Questions regarding MATRIX P2P, nodes, the MATRIX network, Consensus algorithms, etc

ðŸš€Progress update on the development of MATRIX, milestones, etc

ðŸš€MATRIX AI development

Questions of the top concerns are mainly collected from MATRIX community members, and our experts will always be there to answer and explain.

Thanks to all our community members and fans who sent us questions regarding our work. We received many questions and selected the most repeated ones.


###  QUESTION RECAP(2018.5.30)

1.Do clusters play a part in consensus or is it just the delegated nodes? do they check that the work of the delegate is correct?(Node related Questions) 

2.Can you commit a date for main net token swap?


3.A detailed explanation of the delegate nodes (supernodes): How MATRIX can be more decentralized than EOS? How to choose delegate nodes and achieve consensus?

4.Weâ€™ve recently discovered the BatchOverflow (link) vulnerability bug on ERC-20 smartcontracts. Let us assume that we found a bug on a MATRIX intelligent smartcontract, would the AI automatically fix and secure ALL the smart contracts on the MATRIX blockchain?

5.Can you anticipated ROI for a Masternode and confirm whether the 10k token threshold is confirmed?


### QUESTIONS RECAP (2018.6.11)

1.Despite the great answers from the team, it seems like each week we are left with new questions. Would you be able to release complete yellow-papers detailing completely the technical design framework for consensus, node election, and smart contracts?

2.What hardware do you think will be required in September and December to run a node capable of 1, 000 tps?

3.How many kinds of masternodes will be there?


### QUESTIONS RECAP (2018.6.21)

1.The recent github upload of the crypto GO implementation tells us the different things which have been done and what it contains, for example:
"Signature_cgo.go and crypto.go under crypto are ethereum's original crypto algorithm interface files for external calling, and based on this, we introduced two more interfaces SignEx and VerifySignatureEx which will be used for signature verification. Ecrecover and EcrecoverEx interfaces supports public key recovery. generateKeyEx is the new interface for publick/private key generation"

But it does not tell us why these new interfaces are included and why they are an improvement to the original Ethereum code. Can you tell us?

2.As you know, the consensus mechanism for a project is the most important part for security. Given that MATRIX is using MCMC as a cryptographic hash, will you ensure it is academically and commercially peer reviewed before it goes live? Sha256 and similar algorithms have gone through rigorous academic review.


3.What are and what is needed to have 1000 TPS, which are required to have a mining MATRIX node?

4.As you know, the consensus mechanism for a project is the most important part for security.

### QUESTIONS RECAP (2018.6.29)

1.When can we expect the paper with additional details about  MATRIXâ€™s unique algorithm? 

2.Can you share what CPU youâ€™re using in your Dell R730 server? Is it a 1x CPU or 2x? How much RAM are you using? Some basic specifications will make it easier to research servers and gear.

3.When can we expect the paper with additional details about MATRIXâ€™s unique algorithm? 

### QUESTIONS RECAP (2018.7.6)

1. Can you explain more about the selection process for masternodes? Does holding more MAN increase the odds of being selected for a masternode? How many masternodes are available and for how long can someone be assigned as masternode?
2. Can you explain more about the rewards system in place for validator nodes? So far only the distribution model is known.

### QUESTIONS RECAP (2018.7.13)

Q1. Is it true the random selection algorithm ties a unique ID to your hardware setup for the selection of nodes? if yes, does this mean the odds of being selected for a node increase the more devices you hold MAN on?

Q2. Will miners be able to use multiple separate devices to mine on the same node? The two mining setups shown were each a single device, but it could be more practical for miners to use multiple devices to reach the 1000tps for a MN.

### QUESTIONS RECAP (2018.7.20)

Q1. Lets say I own 50000 MAN and my brother own 50000 MANï¼ŒFrom economical side of view would it be more profitable and make more sense to put tokens together and run verification masternode, then split profits half, or run 2 x 50 000 mining masternodes separatelly.

Q2. What happens when all these tokens are distributed? How wil matrix continue to give rewards to miners and masternodes?  Will smart contracts on Matrix require fuel in the form of MAN? And use these tokens to reward miners and masternodes?


### QUESTIONS RECAP (2018.7.27)

Q1. GitHub update on the PoC, Python Version (last update was 2 months ago), the team puts "Weekly Update" in the folder but seeing no progress.
