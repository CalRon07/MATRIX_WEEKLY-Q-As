#### Q1. Where do the fees paid by external parties applying for the MATRIX AI Comuting powers go? 

ANSWER: Actually, the provider of computing power will get most of the rewards, and the Agent node will also get some of the rewards. The validator nodes gain the GAS.


#### Q2. Users often turn to the smart contracts for a special intention. But what if the owner of the smart contract want to patch it or maliciously change that intention? Is there any way to avoid this?

ANSWER: Patches to the smart contract can only be made when there are new vulnerbilities. They should be approved by the community via online/offline voting, and recorded in one block. Thus the owner can not change his/her contract arbitrarily and defraud the users.
