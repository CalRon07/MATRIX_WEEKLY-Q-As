#### Q1. I am using the Intel Xeon processor to build master nodes. And I want to know which one is more important, clock speed or the cores of processor? Is it true that a 10-core CPU with a relatively high clock speed is better than a 12-core CPU with a relatively low clock speed?

ANSWER: Our design can support running on a single core, but with very low speed. Generally, we need to configure Core Task Assignment for the CPU. 

Currently, there is one exclusive core for each of P2P network, Consensus Algorithm and Transaction Packing. As regards the Encryption and Decryption, as well as Signature Validation, n cores will be used, where each core can support up to 5,000 signature validations or signatures. Note that they are independent. A high consumption of cores will happen to support 50,000 TPS.

Based on the normal network speed design, MATRIX need 8 cores to act as a validator, and an additional signle core will be necessary for mining.
