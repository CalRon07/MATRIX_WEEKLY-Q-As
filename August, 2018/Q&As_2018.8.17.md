#### Q1. Could you describe in detail about the format of MATRIX network wallet address?

Answer: Considering the compatibility of wallets, MATRIX's wallet address is designed to be of the same format as Ethereum. As we consulted with many wallet partners, separate operations will be needed with different partners without the  compatibility with Ethereum. And many customers are not willing to record so many wallet addresses.

However, this will make transactinos vulnerable to the replay attack, which means transactions from Ethereum may appear on MATRIX. To solve this issue, MATRIX will distinguish transactions based on the top bit of Nonce. If it is 1, then it's legal. If it is 0, it will not be accepted.

In addition, MATRIX introudces many new transaction types, including one-many transactions, timing transactions, third-party paid GAS transactions, as well as credit guaranty transactions, in order to enrich MATRIX's applications, and support the future businesses of DEX. These are not supported by Ethereum currently. 

As you may also know, MATRIX will progressively replace the Ethereum's hash algorithm with a more meaningful one. And a innovative network for computing power output will be provided for sharing computing powers of each node. This is also a new kind of transaction.
