#### Q1. Could you describe in detail about the format of MATRIX network wallet address?

Answer: Considering the compatibility of wallets, MATRIX's wallet address is designed to be of the same format as Ethereum. As we consulted with many wallet partners, separate operations will be needed with different partners without the  compatibility with Ethereum. And many customers are not willing to record so many wallet addresses.

However, this will make transactinos vulnerable to the replay attack, which means transactions from Ethereum may appear on MATRIX. To solve this issue, MATRIX will distinguish transactions based on the top bit of Nonce. If it is 1, then it's legal. If it is 0, it will not be accepted.



另外，新增加了一对多的交易，定时交易，第三方代付GAS交易，以及信用担保交易。这些也是为了丰富MATRIX的应用，并开展去中心化交易所的业务。这些是原来以太坊不具备的。

除此之外，MATRIX会逐步替换以太坊的HASH算法，并提供算力输出网络，方便各个节点输出本地的算力，这也是一种新的交易。
